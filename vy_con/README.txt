This Cortana script allows users to control and manage Vyatta routers. It is designed to 
particularly aid is mass command and control of Vyatta. 


The Vyatta Tab is exposed via a menu option Cobalt Strike -> Vyatta Tab. Upon recognition 
of a Vyatta Device, you must mark the host as Vyatta. The host will then appear in the 
Tab. You can mass select hosts in the tab and issue commands via the button. Currently
your shell must be as the root user or in the normal bash prompt... the vbash shell 
will not be useable for the control with the tab. 

Limited manual commands will be exposed via the Cortana Console.

Things it can do:
    -Mass issue commands
    -Mass user management
    -Mass backdooring

Future Enhancements:
	-More commands
	-Control from either vbash or bash (root or vyatta user)

Happy Hacking!
